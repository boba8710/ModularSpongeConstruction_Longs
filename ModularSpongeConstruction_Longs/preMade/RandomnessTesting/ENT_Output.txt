Entropy = 7.999998 bits per byte.

Optimum compression would reduce the size
of this 102400000 byte file by 0 percent.

Chi square distribution for 102400000 samples is 232.57, and randomly
would exceed this value 83.99 percent of the times.

Arithmetic mean value of data bytes is 127.4968 (127.5 = random).
Monte Carlo value for Pi is 3.142087857 (error 0.02 percent).
Serial correlation coefficient is -0.000019 (totally uncorrelated = 0.0).
